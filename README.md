# CALCULATOR
Hello folks, Here I have tried to make a fully functional calculator without any GUI. This code has all the mathematical features of all operators and also multiple expressions at a single time. The whole program is runned in a while loop which enables the user a tension free movement in the whole code. Also the program I  have written is beginner friendly and I have not tried to make it more complex.

## MAIN FEATURES
1) All mathematical and complex mathematical calculations.
2) Conversion of all the fundamental units like time, volume, speed, angle, mass, data and much more is also included.
3) Contains the option of date calculator i.e it can add the entered number of days to the entered date.
4) Also contains the scientific and programmer calculator, which are now Under Development and would be added soon. Stay updated for it.
